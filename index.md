I'm a research scientist in the Oxford team at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/).
I did my DPhil in the [Quantum Group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/)
at the [University of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford),
supervised by [Bob Coecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Coecke)
and [Dan Marsden](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/dan.marsden/).
I am a founder and developer of [DisCoPy](https://discopy.org), the Python software
for computing with string diagrams.

My main research interests are [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing), [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
and [applied category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_category_theory).
I worked on [DisCoCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisCoCat)
and [quantum natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_natural_language_processing).
I also worked on [Hopf algebras](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/Giovanni), [fermionic circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01231.pdf),
the [ZX calculus](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-03-25-421/)
and [dataflow programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531130.3533365),
all using [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram).

At Quantinuum, my efforts are focused at developing graphical languages
for [quantum optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optics),
compilation software for [linear optical circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12985),
and running experiments on currently available [photonic hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_quantum_photonics).
